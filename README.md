 Performed power analysis of a half subtractor circuit using parametric analysis for 180nm technology with Cadence Virtuoso  

 The analysis of the average power consumption for different configurations of the half subtractor 
circuit reveals notable trends and implications. Across varying βp/βn ratios and transistor 
dimensions, there is a discernible impact on power consumption at both 5V and 2.5V supply 
voltages. Notably, configurations with smaller βp/βn ratios and reduced transistor sizes tend to 
exhibit lower average power consumption, indicating the effectiveness of transistor sizing in 
managing power efficiency. Additionally, the decrease in supply voltage from 5V to 2.5V leads to 
a significant reduction in power consumption across all configurations, highlighting the importance 
of voltage scaling as a key strategy for mitigating power usage in digital circuits. These findings 
underscore the significance of careful transistor sizing and voltage optimization in achieving 
energy-efficient designs for digital circuits, crucial for a wide range of applications where power 
consumption is a critical consideration.
